# method

Matches HTTP requests based on their method.

## Description

This directive filters the incoming request by its HTTP method. Only requests with
the specified method are passed on to the inner route. All others are rejected with a
`MethodRejection`, which is translated into a `405 Method Not Allowed` response
by the default `RejectionHandler`.
